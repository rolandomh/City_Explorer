## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? 
data directory - containing location.json and weather.json


.env - with your PORT. Make sure this file is in your .gitignore.
README.md - with documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development. Check the "documentation" section below for more details on how that should look AT MINIMUM
.gitignore - with standard NodeJS configurations
.eslintrc.json - with Code 301 course standards for the linter
package.json - with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration. The dependencies needed for today's lab include: express, dotenv, and cors.
Note that the package-lock.json file is automatically created when dependencies are installed and ensures that future installations of the project use the same versions of the dependencies.
Deploy your basic express server to Heroku.
